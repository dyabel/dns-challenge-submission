# Intel N-DNS Track 2

The objective in Track 2 is to develop a high-quality real-time audio denoising system that operates efficiently on Loihi 2. The solution must follow the following structure: noisy audio is encoded into a form suitable for processing on a neuromorphic system, processed on a neuromorphic system, and decoded into a clean output audio waveform. Solutions are evaluated by audio quality metrics and computational resource usage metrics and are subject to a minimum audio quality and maximum latency (real-time) requirement. The encoder and decoder run on CPU and the neromorphic denoiser runs on Loihi 2.

Track 2 guarantees that neuromorphic denoising solutions can indeed run on actual neuromorphic hardware. This track provides a rigorous demonstration of power and latency benefits realized by neuromorphic hardware.
