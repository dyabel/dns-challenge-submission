# Intel N-DNS Team Setup Instructions

To be considered for the Intel N-DNS Challenge prize in Track 1 (Algorithmic) or Track 2 (Loihi), each participant must register with Intel.
During registration, participants may indicate whether they are a Team Leader and their Team Name. For participants who are not Team Leaders,
the Team Name should match exactly the name provided by the Team Leader.

Teams are not required to have more than one team member. For official purposes, the Team Leader will be solely responsible for team
submissions and for receipt of any prizes awarded to a team.

Each team will be responsible for creating a Github repository for the solution submission. This repository should follow the
format https://github.com/user-name/ndns-team-name.
